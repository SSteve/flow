A multi-vowel morphing format filter.  As the interpolation value changes, the filter shifts through a sequence of vowels.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The partials input source.
<dt>Interpolation
<dd>The current position of the filter in the sequence of vowels.
<dt>Num Vowels
<dd>The number of vowels in the sequence.
<dt>Gain
<dd>A post-filtering increase in amplitude for the partials.
<dt>Num Formants
<dd>The number of formants used in producing the vowel.
<dt>Resonance
<dd>The strength of each formant.  A higher resonance makes formants peakier and narrower.
<dt>Vowel <i>n</i>
<dd>The vowels available are A, E, I, and U for bass, tenor, contra tenor, alto, and soprano voices.  
<dt>Four Pole
<dd>Sets the bandpass filters in the formant filter to be four pole rather than two-pole
