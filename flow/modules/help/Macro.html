This is a <b>Macro.</b> A Macro is a patch that you have loaded as a module.  

<ul>
<li>Any partials or modulation outputs the patch has attached to its <b>Out</b> module will appear here as outputs.
<p><li>Any partials or modulation inputs the patch has attached to using an <b>In</b> will appear here as inputs.
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>Info
<dd>Provides the version, author, date, and information of the patch loaded as a Macro.
<dt>On Tr
<dd>If you send a trigger here, the Macro's underlying modules will receive a Gate (Note On) message, effectively resetting them.
<dt>Off Tr
<dd>If you send a trigger here, the Macro's underlying modules will receieve a Release (Note Off) message.
<dt>Pause
<dd>If this is set, then On Tr has another feature: as long as On Tr's value is set to zero (0.0), then the Macro's underlying modules will be paused: they won't recieve any steps.  This can save computational power when used in combination with Switch or Morph, whose output triggers also go to zero.  Be careful using this feature: see the manual.
