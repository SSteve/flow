A filter producing flanger and phaser effects.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The partials input source.
<dt>Wet
<dd>The degree of effect of the flanging on the original signal.
<dt>OffsetMod
<dd>The phase offset of the flange humps, typically modulated by an LFO.
<dt>Stretch
<dd>The base size of the flange humps.
<dt>StretchMod
<dd>The additional modulated size of the flange humps, typically via an LFO.
<dt>Style
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Linear
<dd>The humps are triangle-shaped up-down lines.
<dt>Spike Up
<dd>The humps are rounded on the bottom and spiked on the top, like a feedback comb filter.
<dt>Spike Down
<dd>The humps are rouned on the top and spiked on the bottom, like a forward comb filter.
<dt>Curvy
<dd>The humps are S-shaped in the middle and round both at top and bottom.
<dt>Spikey
<dd>The humps are S-shaped in the middle and spiked both at the top and bottom.
</dl>
<dt>Fixed
<dd>The base flange filter frequency does not shift with the pitch of the note.
<dt>Fundamental
<dd>The fundamental is included in the flanging.
