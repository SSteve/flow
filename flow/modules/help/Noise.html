Different colors of random noise.

<p>Noise is generated by rapidly creating and destroying partials at random frequencies and (possibly) amplitudes.

<dl>
<dt>High
<dd>The upper bound for partial frequencies. If Hi
gh &lt; Low, then the two bounds are swapped.
<dt>Low
<dd>The lower bound for partial frequencies. If High &lt; Low, then the two bounds are swapped.
<dt>Partials
<dd>The number of partials created at any one time.  Low numbers of partials create a kind of dribbly effect.
<dt>Amp Var
<dd>The degree of randomness in the partial amplitudes.
<dt>Ramp
<dd>The ramp in partial amplitudes.  This produces different colored noise.  At 0.0, amplitude partials are maximal at the lower bound and drop linearly until they are zero at the higher bound.  At 1.0 it is the opposite.  And at 0.5, amplitude partials are all the same value.
<dt>Gain
<dd>The noise volume.
<dt>Seed
<dd>The random number seed for the noise generator.  This sees to it that the noise is the same from note to note.  If you would like nondeterministic noise, set the seed to Free.
<dt>Top
<dd>The partials used to generate the noise are set to the top <i>n</i> partials in the partials list: the remainder are set to 0 frequency and 0 amplitude.  (When unchecked, they are set to the bottom partials, and the remainder are set to a high frequency and 0 amplitude).  This can have impacts on modules like Combine, where the partials discarded are the highest frequency.

<p>If you want more sophisticated coloration to your sound, set the ramp to 0.5 (producing white noise) and run the sound through a high pass, low pass, or band pass filter.
