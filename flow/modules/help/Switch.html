Switches between up to eight different sources.

<p>You select the new sound to play by sending a trigger the corresponding modulation input.  Select will then interpolate the frequencies and amplitudes between the old sound and the newly chosen sound until old sound is entirely faded out.  You can use this in combination with the individual modulation outputs of an envelope to select one sound, then another, then a final sound, for example.  

<p>If you instead send a trigger to <i>next</i>, this will cause the next sound to trigger, wrapping around.

<p>The first selected sound is always A.

<dl>
<dt>Input A ... H
<dd>The eight input partials sources
<dt>Trig A ... H [Input]
<dd>When triggered, selects the corresponding input.
<dt>Next
<dd>When trigered, selects the next input.
<dt>Rate  
<dd>The rate at which the sounds are faded in/out.  This is useful for preventing pops when a new sound is suddenly selected.
<dt>Free
<dd>When a Note On occurs, Select does not reset to input A, but instead starts right where it had left off.
