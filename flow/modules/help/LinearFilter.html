A multi-peak filter.  You specify the gain and frequency of up to 8 peaks and valleys, and the filter interpolates linearly between them.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The partials input source.
<dt>Nodes
<dd>The number of peaks and valleys
<dt>Base
<dd>This frequency value is added to the frequencies of all the nodes to shift them positively or negatively.
<dt>Freq <i>n</i>
<dd>The frequency of node <i>n</i>
<dt>Gain <i>n</i>
<dd>The gain of node <i>n</i>
<dt>Relative
<dd>The filter frequencies are shifted with pitch.
