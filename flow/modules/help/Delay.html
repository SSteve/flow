An initial delay, followed by a repeated delay.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The input partials to delay.
<dt>Wet
<dd>The wetness of the delay (how much delay is passed through versus the original partials signal).
<dt>Initial Delay
<dd>The initial delay time
<dt>Later Delays
<dd>The delay time for each of the repeated later delays
<dt>Initial Cut
<dd>The cut in amplitude of the initial delay relative to the original signal.
<dt>Later Cuts
<dd>The cut in amplitude of the later delays relative to the amplitude of each previous delay.
