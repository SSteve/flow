When triggered, drops random partials into its output sound, creating a tinkling effect.

<dl>
<dt>Trigger
<dd>Triggers Tinkle to drop some partials.
<dt>Decay
<dd>How quickly a partial's amplitude decays away.
<dt>Volume
<dd>Initial amplitude of a new dropped partial.
<dt>Number
<dd>The number of partials to create each trigger.
<dt>Probability
<dd>The probability that a trigger will create any partials at all.
<dt>Seed
<dd>The random number seed.  This allows the tinkle pattern to be exactly the same (deterministic) each time you press a note.  Alternatively you can set the seed to Free, which makes the pattern nondeterministic.  Free is particularly useful if you want new jitter every time you press a note.
