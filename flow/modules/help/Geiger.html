A source of randomly-timed pulses.  A pulse is a square wave pulse plus a trigger.  

<p>As incoming pulses arrive, with some probability a counter is increased.  When the counter reaches a certain value, it is reset to 0 and Geiger changes from 0 to 1 or vice versa, and issues a pulse.

<dl>
<dt>Trials
<dd>The size of the counter.  If 1, then Geiger just outputs a pulse with the given probability every time it receives a pulse.  If &gt;= 1, then pulses are more regular (the variance is decreased) but also corresponsingly slower in rate.
<dt>Prob
<dd>The probability that the counter will be increased on an incoming pulse.
<dt>Trigger
<dd>The incoming pulses
<dt>Seed
<dd>The random number seed, to guarantee determinism in the pulses.  If Free, then Geiger is nondeterministic.
<dt>Pulsing
<dd>After raising from 0 to 1, Geiger will always drop back to 0 on the next incoming pulse; and when dropping it will not issue a trigger.  This produces an up/down effect rather than changing from 0 to 1 or vice versa.
