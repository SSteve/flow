A source of randomly-timed pulses.  A pulse is a square wave pulse plus a trigger.  

<p>As incoming pulses arrive, with some probability a counter is increased.  When it reaches a certain size, it is reset to 0 and Geiger issues a pulse.

<dl>
<dt>Trials
<dd>The size of the counter.  If 1, then Geiger just outputs a pulse with the given probability every time it receives a pulse.  If &gt;= 1, then pulses are more regular (the variance is decreased) but also corresponsingly slower in rate.
<dt>Prob
<dd>The probability that the counter will be increased on an incoming pulse.
<dt>Trigger
<dd>The incoming pulses
<dt>Seed
<dd>The random number seed, to guarantee determinism in the pulses..  If Free, then Geiger is nondeterministic.
