Mix (add) the amplitudes of up to four sets of partials.  The frequencies of the partials in all four sets are reset to the frequencies of the first set of partials.


<dl>
<dt>Input A ... D
<dd>The four original inputs
<dt>Gain A ... D
<dd>The amplitudes of inputs A...D will be multiplied against these prior to mixing.

<dt>Sum
<dd>Mix the amplitudes by adding them.
