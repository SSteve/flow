Adds random jitter noise to the frequencies and amplitudes of partials.

<p>Jitter only adds noise when receiving a trigger and on NOTE ON.  Each time it receives a trigger it changes the noise provided.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The partials input
<dt>Freq Var
<dd>The degree of jitter noise applied to the frequencies of the partials.
<dt>Amp Var
<dd>The degree of jitter noise applied to the amplitudes of the partials.
<dt>Trigger
<dd>Tiggers the module to change its jitter noise
<dt>Seed
<dd>The random number seed for the jitter.  This allows the jitter pattern to be exactly the same (deterministic) each time you press a note.  Alternatively you can set the seed to Free, which makes the pattern nondeterministic.  Free is particularly useful if you want new jitter every time you press a note.
<dt>Non-Zero
<dd>Jitter is only applied to non-zero amplitude partials.  This is useful when combining Jitter with Fill.
<dt>Amp Ratio
<dd>The amplitude jitter should be proportional to the current amplitude value, as opposed to just fixed random noise.
