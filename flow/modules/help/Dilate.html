Boosts the amplitude of partials on either side of the locally highest-amplitude partials in a sound.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The input partials to delay.
<dt>Boost
<dd>The degree to which the partials are increased to approach the amplitude of their higher neighbors.
<dt>Direction
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Lower
<dd>Only partials lower in frequency than a higher-amplitude neighbor are boosted.
<dt>Higher
<dd>Only partials higher in frequency than a higher-amplitude neighbor are boosted.
<dt>Both
<dd>Partials on both sides of a higher-amplitude neighbor are boosted.
