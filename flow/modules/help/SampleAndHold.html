Takes an incoming modulation signal and a trigger, and samples the signal when triggered, outputting only that sample.  

<dl>
<dt>Signal
<dd>The incoming signal to sample.
<dt>Trigger
<dd>When a trigger is received here, the sample is taken.
<dt>Type
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>S &amp; H
<dd> Sample and Hold mode only.  On receiving a trigger, samples the signal and outputs that value until the next trigger, when it resamples etc.
<dt>T &amp; H
<dd>Track and Hold mode.  The trigger toggles between Sample and Hold Mode, or letting it pass through normally.  When a gate is received, we start in Sample and Hold Mode.
<dt>T &amp; H 2
<dd>Track and Hold mode #2.  The trigger toggles between Sample and Hold Mode, or letting it pass through normally.  When a gate is received, we start passing through normally.
