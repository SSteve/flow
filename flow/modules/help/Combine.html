Combines the partials of two input sources.

<p>This throws all the partials together and removes the highest frequency half of them, leaving the remainder.

<p>This module has a constraints facility (at its bottom): this facility constrains to the first input only.

<dt>Input A and Input B
<dd>The two inputs
<dt>Scale A and Scale B
<dd>Scales the amplitudes of the two inputs prior to combining them.
<dt>Merge
<dd>If two partials have identical frequencies, they are treated as a single partial whose amplitude is their sum.  This allows more unique partials to be included but can create pops if partials move about and merge into one another.
<dt>Half
<dd>Half of the partials of each source are guaranteed to be in the final result.  This is done by eliminating the highest frequency partials of each input <i>first</i>, then combining them.
