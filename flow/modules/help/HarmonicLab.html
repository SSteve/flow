A programmmable, modulatable harmonics generator.

<p>Adds up to three kinds of waves.  Each wave has a particular low pass filtering function and is constrained to a set of harmonics.  If an earlier wave uses a given harmonic, it takes precedence over later waves.

<dl>
<dt>Amt 1 ... 3
<dd>The strength of the filtering of the given wave.
<dt>Gain 1 ... 3
<dd>The amplitude of the partials in the given wave.
<dt>Type 1 ... 3
<dd>The filter shape.  The shapes are given by their equation.
<dt>Constraint 1 ... 3
<dd>The harmonics to which the wave is constrained.
