Shifts a set of partials up or down, wrapping partials beyond a certain boundary to the other side.  This creates a barber-pole effect.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The input partials source.
<dt>Rotate
<dd>Degree of rotation from 0.0 to 1.0 (a full period).
<dt>Upper
<dd>The upper boundary: the highest frequency. If t
he upper boundary is less than the lower boundary,
the two are swapped.
<dt>Lower
<dd>The lower boundary: the lowest frequency.  If the upper boundary is less than the lower boundary, the two are swapped.
<dt>Thin
<dd>Thins out partials from the source.
<dt>Stretch
<dd>Stretches the frequencies of the partials prior to rotation.  
<dt>Window
<dd>Windows the amplitudes of the partials prior to rotation.
<dt>Center
<dd>Place the peak of the stretching in the center (and symmetric) as opposed to the lower boundary.
<dt>Solo
<dd>Mute all partials outside the boundaries.
