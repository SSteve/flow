A thickener via detuning.  This module works by taking highest frequency half of the partials and reassigning them the same frequencies as the lowest half.  It then detunes the reassigned partials by some degree and sets the amplitudes to some fraction of the lower ones.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The input partials
<dt>Wet
<dd>The volume of the detuned partials relative to the originals.
<dt>Detune
<dd>The degree of detuning in cents.
