A set of tools to allow you to manually trigger or set modulations.  This could be used for testing purposes or for live performance.

<dl>
<dt>A ... D
<dd>Setting the input dial value in turn outputs the exact same value in the corresponding output modulation.  This is useful if you need to manually change several dials simultaneously to the same value.  For example, if you have three LFOs and you need to change all of their rates at the same time, you could hook them all up to the provided output here, then change them all by modifying the corresponding input dial.

<dt>Tr A ... D
<dd>Pressing a button sends a trigger along the previously mentioned outputs A ... D 
</dl>
