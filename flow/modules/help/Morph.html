Interpolates the amplitudes and frequencies of partials from among four different sources in turn.

<p>When there are only two inputs, the Interpolation knob interpolates between the two of them.

<p>When there are more than two inputs, the Interpolation knob starts by interpolating between the first two: but when it reaches 1.0, it begins interpolating between the second and third.  When it reaches 0.0 it begins interpolating between the third and fourth, and so on.

<p>Morph's interpolation is computed as follows.  We take the first partial from both active sources, and produce a partial which is a weighted average of the two both in terms of frequency and amplitude.  Then we do this for the second partial, and so on.

<p>Morph doesn't just pair up the #1 partials and then the #2 partials, etc.  It can also map the partials to each other in complex ways.

<dl>
<dt>Input A ... D
<dd>The four input partials sources
<dt>Trig A ... D
<dd>Triggers fired when Morph begins using the partials source in question.  This can be used to inform another module that a new sound is beginning.
<dt>Interpolation
<dd>The current interpolation weight value.
<dt>Variance.  
<dd>The randomness in mapping when the Type is Random.
<dt>Seed
<dd>Random number seed used when the Type is Random.  This seed guarantees that the randomness is deterministic: it's the same order every time a note is played.  If you set the Seed to Free, then it will be completely nondeterministic.
<dt>Type
<dd>Morph can pair up partials in complex ways rather than just line #1 up with #1 and #2 up with #2 etc.
<dl>
<dt>Normal
<dd>Partial #1 is paired with #1, #2 is paired with #2, and so on.
<dt>Random
<dd>The ordering of the partials is shuffled randomly in one source relative to the other.
<dt>2-Pair
<dd>Reversed groups of 2.  Partial #1 is paired with #2, #2 with #1, #3 with #4, #4 with #3, and so on.
<dt>4-Pair
<dd>Reversed groups of 4.  Partial #1 is paired with #4, #2 with #3, #3 with #2, #4 with #1, and so on.
<dt>8-Pair
<dd>Reversed groups of 8
<dt>Increasing
<dd>The first pair is a 2-pair.  The next pair is a 4-pair.  The next pair is an 8-pair.  The next pair is a 16-pair.  And so on.
</dl>
<dt>Fundamental
<dd>The fundamental is included in the pairing mapping.  If not the fundamentals are mapped to one another.
<dt>Frequency
<dd>Interpolate the partial frequencies
<dt>Amplitude
<dd>Interpolate the partial amplitudes
<dt>Free
<dd>When a Note On occurs, Morph does not reset to the first two inputs used, but instead starts right where it had left off.
<dt>Random
<dd>Instead of iterating sequentially through the sources, Morph will select its new source at random each time.  The random seed is determined by <i>Seed</i>.
