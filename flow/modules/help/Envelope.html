A general-purpose envelope with many stages.  Envelope contains stages in three regions: the <b>Pre-Sustain</b> region, the <b>Sustain</b> region, and the <b>Release</b> (or Post-Sustain</b>) region.  When the envelope is triggered, it moves through its pre-sustain stages, then it optionally loops through its sustain stages until Note Off occurs, at which point it moves through its Release stages.

<dl>
<dt>Start
<dd>The initial level to start at
<dt>Pre <i>n</i> ... Level
<dd>The time to progress through stage <i>n</i>, and the level reached at the end of the stage.  If the time is <b>off</b>, the stage is skipped.
<dt>Sus <i>n</i> ... Level
<dd>The time to progress through stage <i>n</i>, and the level reached at the end of the stage.  If the time is <b>off</b>, the stage is skipped.
<dt>Rel <i>n</i> ... Level
<dd>The time to progress through stage <i>n</i>, and the level reached at the end of the stage.  If the time is <b>off</b>, the stage is skipped.
<dt>On Tr
<dd>Triggers the Note-On trigger.  Otherwise, a NOTE ON event performs this trigger.
<dt>Off Tr
<dd>Triggers the Note-Off trigger.  Otherwise, a NOTE OFF event performs this trigger. 
<dt>Curve
<dd>The curve taken by all stages.  See the manual for a description of the available curves.
<dt>Type
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>Sustain
<dd>The sustain region works through the sustain stages, then stays at the end of the final one.
<dt>Sustain Loop
<dd>The sustain region loops through its stages.
<dt>One Shot
<dd>The envelope works its way through all stages, with no looping, regardless of any Note Off event.
<dt>Play Through
<dd>The envelope works its way through all stages, with no looping, but on Note Off it skips forward to the release stages if it has not reached them yet.
<dt>Loop w/Rel (Loop with Release)
<dd>The envelope loops through all stages, and stops looping on Note Off
<dt>Loop
<dd>The envelope loops through all stages forever.  It resets to the first stage on Note On.
</dl>
<dt>Gate Reset
<dd>When a Note On occurs, the envelope immediately resets to the Start level.  Otherwise the envelope starts from whatever level it is currently at (the default).
<dt>MIDI Sync
<dd>Delay, Attack, Decay, and Release times assume that we are playing at 120 BPM.  If MIDI sync is faster (or slower), these times will be correspondingly faster (or slower).
<dt>Pre 1, 2, 3, Sus 1, 2, 3, Rel 1, 2, E
<dd>Trigger outputs which fire when the envelope reaches its Pre 1 ... 3, Sus 1 ... 3, or Rel 1 ... 2 stages, or Ends.
