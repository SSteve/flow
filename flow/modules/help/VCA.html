Amplifies all of the partials by a given amount.

<p>Partials are amplified by multiplying their amplitudes first against <b>Mod</b>, and then against <b>Scale</b>.  

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The input partials to amplify
<dt>Mod 
<dd>Ranges from 0...1, and used to modulate the VCA amplitude.
<dt>Scale
<dd>Ranged from 0...8, and normally used to manually set the maximum amplitude modulation.
