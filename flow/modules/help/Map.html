Maps a signal to between a set of bounds.  

<p>In normal configuration, the incoming signal is mapped so that 0.0 ... 1.0 maps to A ... B and is then output.  That is, for a given input x, the output y = A + (B - A) * x.

<dl>
<dt>Signal
<dd>The original input.
<dt>Bound A
<dd>The first bound.
<dt>Bound B
<dd>The second bound.
<dt>Inverse
<dd>Instead of mapping 0.0 ... 1.0 -> A ... B, the converse is true: A ... B is mapped to 0.0 ... 1.0.You can use Inverse to un-map a value mapped by an earlier Map.
<dt>Flip
<dd>The input signal is flipped (subtracted from 1.0) prior to mapping.
<dt>Center
<dd>Instead of defining A and B directly, we define a <b>Center</b> and a <b>Variance</b> (and the dials change accordingly).  Thus A = min(0, Center - Variance) and B = max(Center + Variance)
