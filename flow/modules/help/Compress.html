Compresses (or Expands) the partial amplitudes.  Compression squeezes the amplitudes exponentially towards 1.0.  Expansion pushes them exponentially away from 1.0.

<dt>Input
<dd>The partials source
<dt>Scale
<dd>If this is &gt; 0.5, then the partials are compressed more and more.  If this is &lt 0.5, then the partials are expanded more and more.  At 0.5 this module does nothing.
