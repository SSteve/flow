Outputs partials from wavetable.

<p>Traditionaly a wavetable is a list of single-cycle waves, and you can modulate which wave is being outputted.  Flow doesn't have waves: instead Flow's wavetable is a list of sets f partials: the effect is the same.

<p>The Wavetable module can load wavetables from .WAV files.  A good source of these files is <b>waveeditonline.com</b>  You can also load a raw sound sample as a .WAV file, and it will be treated as a wavetable, creating a vocoder effect.

<dl>
<dt>Position
<dd>Where in the wavetable we should select the wave to output.
<dt>Interpolate
<dd>If the position specified is in between two waves, should we output a wave that is the interpolation (average) of the two, or should we just output the wave that is nearest?
<dt>Wavetable...
<dd>Loads the wavetable
<dt>Sample...
<dd>Loads a sample as if it were wavetable.  This does some additional smoothing on the sample to convert it appropriately.
