# Flow Experimental Patches 

This is a small collection of interesting experimental patches.

* **Bell**   
  A church bell simulation.  This uses individual envelopes to control the prime, tierce, etc. harmonics of a church bell.

* **Formant Test**  
  A test of the Formant module.

* **Shepard Tone**   
  A Shepard Tone is the "barber shop pole" of sounds -- a patch which presents a sound that feels like it's forever going up by introducing low frequencies and slowly tamping out the high oes.
